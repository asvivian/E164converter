--  FUNCTIONALITY --

A. GOAL (as requested by Kimberly Cordero of Josh DeShong Real Estate)

    "Write a function that accepts a user input phone number as a string
     and returns a normalized United States phone number in E. 164 format.
     Return null (or an equivalent value) if the user input is invalid."

B. SOLUTION

[NOTE: An executable of the solution can be found in the "dist/Debug/Cygwin-Windows" folder named "joshdeshong.exe"]

There are two functions which ultimately accomplish the goal with documentation
given in great detail within the main.cpp file. Here are the function 
descriptions as they appear in the code:

/*
 * Boolean Function: isValidInput
 * 
 * Description:
 *     Tests the validity of an input against the requirements for a phone
 *     number without an international identifier
 * 
 * Parameters: 
 *     Takes in a C++ String object called "s" which is the input to be tested
 * 
 * Functionality:
 *     1. Check that the input is 10 characters long, the proper length of a
 *        phone number without the international identifier. Otherwise, 
 *        return false.
 *     2. Check that every character in the input is an integer value between
 *        0 and 9. Otherwise, return false.
 *     3. If the function reaches the last line, the input must be valid, so
 *        return true.
 */

/*
 * String Object Function: E164getter
 * 
 * Description:
 *     Receives a phone number from the user which, if valid, is converted to
 *     E164 format assuming it to be a US number. Otherwise, NULL is returned.
 * 
 * Parameters: 
 *     N/A
 * 
 * Functionality:
 *     1. Prompt the user for a 10 digit input of only integers then receive
 *        that value through the standard input stream.
 *     2. Test whether or not the input is valid. If it is, return the user's
 *        input in E.164 format (USA number assumed). Otherwise, an empty
 *        string is returned (std::string equivalent of NULL).

C. REASONING, ASSUMPTIONS, and SOURCES

I decided to write my solution in C++ as my most comfortable language is C
but C++ (which is very similar) is a lot more common in the industry.

The process of my solution isn't particularly complicated. It, with several
assumptions made, follows the guidelines described in the goal. Here is a 
re-written version of the goal that includes assumptions that I made in writing 
my solution:

  Write a function(s) that accepts a user input phone number as a string in the
  format XXXXXXXXXX (no spaces or dashes) and returns a normalized United States
  phone number in the format +1XXXXXXXXXX (E. 164 format). If the entry was not
  in the requested format, return null (or an equivalent value). Also add
  functionality to the file so that a reviewer may see the solution in action.

My code and documentation may seem over the top for what is, ultimately,
a very simple solution, but I wanted to demonstrate the professional level and
style of my code while also demonstrating my understanding of the solution.

As for sources, there is no source that I could specifically reference for the
coding aspect of this solution, as my knowledge of C++ and programming is a
compilation of all that I was taught in school and/or found on my own time over
the last several years.

I did, however, not originally know that the format of a phone number preceded 
by an international identifier code was referred to as E. 164. The site that
I learned this from is linked below:
